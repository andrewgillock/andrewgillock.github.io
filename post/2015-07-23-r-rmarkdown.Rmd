```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)
```

*Python has proven to be quite useful, but especially in saving time with functions not available in R. An example can be seen below:*

```{r}
#in R
first <- "and"
last <- "rew"
#concatenate
paste(first, last, sep = "", collapse = NULL)
```

```{python}
#in python
first = "and"
last = "rew"
#concatenate
first + last
```

*Despite performing the same operation and displaying the same output, Python can be faster than R in certain situations.*

*The reticulate package demonstrates the interaction between R and Python.*

```{r}
library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{python}
x = list(range(1,11))
y = list(range(1,21,2))
```

```{r}
ggplot() + geom_line(aes(py$x, py$y))
```
